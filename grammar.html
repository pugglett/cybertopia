      <center><h1>Direct and Indirect Objects</h1></center>

      <blockquote> <p><b>Direct objects:</b> <em>a noun or pronoun that directly receives the action of the verb.</em></p>

<p>EX: Dante threw the ball.</p>

<p> Ball is the direct object. Dante took the <b>BALL</b> and threw it. </p>

<p>Challenges with direct objects include: </p>
<ul>
<li>A verb may have two direct objects and when asking a question, the direct object may be the interrogative pronoun what, which, or whom.</li> 

<li>It cannot be where, how, or when. These are adverbs. Sometimes it helps to keep all words in the sentence but change it into a declarative sentence.</li>

</ul>

<p>EX: Bob hit the trash can and the mail box on his way out of the driveway. </p>

 <p>Bob hit both the trash can and the mail box thus two direct objects.</p>

<p>EX: What did you buy? </p>

<p>You bought what?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><b>Indirect objects:</b> <em>is a noun that receives the action the verb, but the action is indirect because it affects the direct object first. </em>

<p> Not all sentences that have a direct object also have an indirect object, <b>but </b> all sentences with an indirect object must have a direct object. </p>


<p>Indirect objects <b>ALWAYS</b> come before the direct object.</p>

<p>EX: I threw Jonas the ball. </p>

<p>Ball is the direct object. Jonas is the indirect object because he received the ball. The ball I threw was directed to him. </p>
