      <center><h1>About</h1></center>

       <blockquote class=color><p>Growing up on the south side of Chicago I knew there was more to life than just my environment. I didn't want to fall subject to my surroundings. I wanted more out of life than the norm. At a young age I tapped into my artistic side and realized I had a passion for fiction writing. It became my outlet and I soon created big dreams of becoming a published author with books that made it to the New York Times Best Selling list, TV shows, and movies. I made this my major goal, but until I am able to reach that I need something that will support me and help me get to that point, as well as be something that I'm genuinely interested in. </p>

        <p>I was introduced to Year Up Chicago the winter of 2014. I was hesitant at first because I had dropped out of college twice deeming that school was not for me. Once I did my research and realized what the program was all about and what they offered I became interested. I had always had a knack for technology but I never considered majoring in the field. I took a chance, applied, and was accepted. I believe it was the best possible decision I could have made for myself at this point in my life.</p>

        <p> Since I've been in the program I've learned a lot, not only about technology, but about myself as well. I've learned that I love software and web development; it has become second nature to me. I found that I especially like web development because it allows me to be creative. I've learned that I am an extremely hard worker and determined to reach my goals by any means necessary. While in the program I have maintained a full time job, and between training and working there have been times that I wanted to give up, but I managed to push through and remember that this is the next step to a successful future for myself. I am excited for what the future holds and I know that this is only the beginning. I am determined to graduate with my fellow colleagues in six months and begin my career. I hope to one day open my own web development company, as well as a publishing company, with a few New York Times Best Selling books under my belt. </p>
