      <center><h1>About</h1></center>
   
       <blockquote class="color3"><p>I am a student at Year up Chicago which is a organization for gears toward young adults showing them a more positive way to success than the normal. The programs cover the basics of IT as far as Hardware, Software, Business communication and Soft Skills. They also take us to various events for example we attended the McCormick place for their technology event. Showing us new tech that has not touch stores. UBS is another event we attended among others. Deeply involved in breaking the opportunity divide showing businesses that no matter where you come from you have something to bring to the table. </p>

<p>My career path in Year up is to advance my skills in project management. The skills set required to have in that field and the type of work they provide interest me. An example of why this is a perfect role for me, I had an experience at a former job that required me to provide leadership. This position required me to keep count of 30+ student on dorm making sure their assignments were completed on the site. Going above the call of duty I took it upon myself to make sure they all attended class. When they did not meet this requirement they were given extra work on the dorm. I also plan on one day joining this wonderful program part time to help those who can not help themselves. I just recently attended an event called Tech week at Merchandise Mart Plaza. Meeting other young and gifted individuals there I networked with several of those spreading the news about the nonprofit organization I am currently employed at.
