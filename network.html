      <h1><center>How to Setup a Network</center></h1>
      <blockquote><p>Ever wondered why your system keeps getting viruses? Well, it is because you did not setup a secure home network. Hackers can slip through any little loop hole and get into your network with little effort. When starting a home network, you will start with a hub and router. With these two objects, you have to code a password that hackers would least expect. Elaborating on the code portion of networking, you should switch out O for a zero or I for a 1. </p> <p> You should also include the different characters of exclamation points and/or dashes. Next, you have to connect with IP addresses and make sure that you do not repeat addresses or else connection will fail. In conclusion, we chose to teach you all networking because it is very important to start with a secure home network to prevent any hacking.

       <blockquote> <p>When you install a router on a network you want to follow the directions of the manufacturer. </p> 

       <p>The first thing you want to do when using Cisco Packet Tracer is set up your router accordingly. Drag the desired router to the document and open it. You then want to go to your configuration tab and rename the router. (Home_Network) </p>

      <p>Next you want to open the GUI tab and change your connection type. There are two types of IP addresses, dynamic IP addresses and static IP addresses. Dynamic is assigned by a server each time it connects to the network. Static is permanently assigned to the computer or device. A DCHP (dynamic host configuration protocol) server is for dynamic IP addresses and gives an IP address to a computer when it first attempts to initiate a connection to the network and requests an IP address. 
Static IP addresses are manually entered as well as the subnet mask.
There are different Classes of IP addresses. The class of your network will determine the subnet mask IP address.You can set your IP address to Public, Private, or Automatic Private 
</p>

<p>You must configure your router before you connect any devices. If you wish to have a private network you will set the password when you set up your router. 


In order to connect your devices you must determine whether they will be on a DCHP server or if it will be static. If it is a DCHP server the IP addresses and subnet masks will already be configured. If it is static you must manually enter the IP addresses as well as enter a password for the wireless. 
</p> 

<p>You must enable the security for the router and set a password for your network for it to be secure. You also want to use the encryption type TKIP (temporary key integrity protocol). This encryption is the strongest when it comes to security. Once you have done so you can begin connecting your devices.</p></blockquote>
