       <blockquote class="color2"><p>Born on October 27, 1992, on the south side of Chicago, I wasn’t as fortunate as most children. That day the odds were already against me because I was born into the Department of Children and Family Services. Being told I wasn’t going anywhere and would never become anything killed every ounce of hope I had as a young child. As I grew older, I came to the conclusion I had to want to do better and become more than expected.</p>
        <p>I joined Year Up Chicago on March 3, 2015 and it was the best decision thus far. Being a part of Year Up has given a new perspective of support and guidance. I not only learn hard skills like: hardware, software, and web development, but I have also polished my soft skills like: holding a professional conversation, write professional emails, and simply how to conduct myself professionally. Feel free to explore my page and I hope you are ready to experience the tech world from my point of view.</p></blockquote>
